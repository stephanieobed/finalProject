				    HOW DOES IT WORK?

				  <div class="content">
				    <p>Using Google Maps, you can view the virtual trail map and easily target what type of hike you'd like. If you're looking for the best place to take in the view - for social media and with your own eyes - you'll be able to choose your path visually, courtesy of photos taken from the trail by fellow hikers.</p>

				<div class="backstory">

				<p>When a lot of people hear the word "hiking," 90% of the time the first thing that comes to mind is a nice leisurely walk in the woods. That's the extent of it.</p>

				<p><b>That isn't real hiking.</b></p>

				<p>My first <b>REAL</b> hike was in November 2013. My new boyfriend at the time had conned me into going, even if it was supposed to be a little chilly out that day we had planned for it. Disregarding the weather and lured under the same thought I described above, plus the premise that it would be simple and relaxing, I was not even close to prepared for what was going to happen. The hike was at Breakneck Ridge - which is appropriately named, considering that you have to scramble (aka rock climb, for those who don't know) up a huge mountain for what feels like eternity before it gets easier. </p>
