				  <div class="active content">
				    <p>Do you like the great outdoors? Looking for some sweet views on the trail? Made for first-time (and seasoned!) hikers of the Hudson Valley of New York, <i>Hik(e)r</i> is a simple way to find and locate the best hikes.</p>
				  </div>
				  <div class="title">
				    HOW DOES IT WORK?
				  </div>
				  <div class="content">
				    <p>Using Google Maps, you can view the virtual trail map and easily target what type of hike you'd like. If you're looking for the best place to take in the view - for social media and with your own eyes - you'll be able to choose your path visually, courtesy of photos taken from the trail by fellow hikers.</p>

				  <div class="title">
				    WHY WOULD YOU NEED THIS?

				  <div class="content">
				    <p>Why wouldn't you? But rly tho. Everyone wants to do it for The Gram.</p>

				<p>By using both Google Maps and Open Street Maps API, you have the best of both worlds. Google provides the standard base layer of the map, and the additional Open Street map layer provides the trails (marked as a small dashed red line) along with the different color routes you may take upon your hike. There are also summit/peak markers on the map, to reflect any climbs and mountains along or around the area. Green areas are forests, marked by the tree icons along the map. 

				<br><br>

				The second part of this project provides images taken by those who have hiked the area before you. Using the Flickr API, the map pulls photos from public feeds, and via geo-tag, plots points along the map corresponding to where the photo was taken. Thus, this provides you with a general idea with what scenery you can expect to see while you're out there on the trail.

				<h2 class="heading-one">Current: Version 1.0</h2>

				<p>Focusing on certain parts of the Hudson Valley, you can trigger the viewfinder by clicking the buttons below the map. These locations are hard-coded for the demo version of this project, and only pick up photos from certain groups via Flickr API that may or not be recent. Photos may also be tagged from other locations based on where their lat/long was when the upload occured. </p>

				<h2 class="heading-one">Future: Version 2.0</h2>

				<p>The scope will broaden to other areas that aren't limited to the Hudson Valley area or New York State. Upon changing locations via movement of the center point of the map, images from that location will be pulled via the API and be accessible.</p>

				<p>When a lot of people hear the word "hiking," 90% of the time the first thing that comes to mind is a nice leisurely walk in the woods. That's the extent of it.</p>

				<p><b>That, my friends, isn't real hiking.</b></p>

				<p>My first <b>REAL</b> hike was in November 2013. Full disclosure: I was conned into doing it. Disregarding the forecasted chilly weather and lured under the same thought I described above - plus the premise that it would be simple and relaxing - I was not even close to prepared for what was going to happen. The hike was at Breakneck Ridge - which is appropriately named, considering that you have to scramble (aka rock climb, for those who don't know) up a huge mountain for what feels like eternity before it gets even the slightest bit easier, even though it's one of the most difficult hikes in the Hudson Valley. In hindsight, I wasn't prepared or ready, and I should have done some more research before embarking.</p>

				<p>I hiked the Breakneck area two more times after the intial trek, the most recent being a few months ago after not touching it for a year. And despite knowing what was in store, I still felt like it was the first time all over again. The trail has gotten much more popular in the last few years, and it's hard to have a quiet time to just concentrate on your ascent up the steep beds of rock. On the way up, I remember talking to and encouraging a few people who were clearly first timers. Most of them didn't know what they were getting into, and that's part of what inspired this project. <p>

				<p><i>(...that, and scrolling through my own Instagram feed and thinking about how much nature stuff is on there.)</i></p>

				<p>It takes endurance and a lot of skill in order to complete any part of that hike, whether you take the shortcut trails or do a full loop that takes up most of your day. Before you go out on any trail, it's best that you do your research and have a clear idea of where you're going. Preparing is half the battle, and that's why this project exists. Because people are always looking to take wonderful photos of where they are, for memories or to show others what they're doing (whether it really looks that easy or not), <b>Hiker</b> is part map and part photo view-finder. The Hudson Valley is a vast beauty in itself when you pick the right time of year, when the leaves change as well when everything is in full foiliage, and I hope this helps you to figure out your trails (and Insta-worthy shots).</p>
